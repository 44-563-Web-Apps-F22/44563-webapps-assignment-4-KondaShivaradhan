    <h5 class=" Melene"> Melene</h5>
    (lazily) We are very well as we are. Life without a
    care—every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
    who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make his
    people happy—what have we to gain by the great change that
    is in store for us?

    <h5 class="Salata">Salata:</h5> What have we to gain? English institutions, English
    tastes, and oh, English fashions!

    <h5 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h5> England has made herself what she is because, in that
    favored land, every one has to think for himself. Here we have
    no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
    and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
    which we subscribe. Oh, think how much more brilliant this
    dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
    our reflective powers! They say that in England the conversation
    of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!

    <h5 class="Tarara">Tarara:</h5> Lalabalele talala! Callabale lalabalica falahle!

    <h5 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h5> (horrified) Stop—stop, I beg!
    <p class="direction">(All the ladies
        close their ears.)</p>
