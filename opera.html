    <h2>Enter Tarara in a great rage</h2>

    <h4>ACT I 
        A Utopian Palm Grove</h4>

    <pre>
        Tarara:   Lalabalele talala!  Callabale lalabalica falahle!

        Calynx:   (horrified)  Stop—stop, I beg!  (All the ladies
        close their ears.)
      
        Tarara:   Callamalala galalate!  Caritalla lalabalee kallalale
        poo!
      
        Ladies:   Oh, stop him!  stop him!
      
        Calynx:   My lord, I'm surprised at you.  Are you not aware that
        His Majesty, in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic wish
        of his people, has ordered that the Utopian language shall be
        banished from his court, and that all communications shall
        henceforward be made in the English tongue?
      
        Tarara:   Yes, I'm perfectly aware of it, although—(suddenly
        presenting an explosive "cracker").  Stop—allow me.
      
        Calynx:   (pulls it).  Now, what's that for?
